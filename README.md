## What is NEXTVM?

NEXTVM is a **lightweight Android virtualization engine** that creates isolated virtual environments on Android devices. Unlike traditional emulators that simulate hardware, NEXTVM uses **Binder proxy interception** and **ActivityThread hooking** to run real Android apps in a sandboxed process — achieving near-native performance with complete isolation.

Think of it as a "parallel universe" for your Android apps — each app runs with its own identity, storage, accounts, and network configuration, completely isolated from the host device and from each other.

### Why NEXTVM?

| Problem | NEXTVM Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Testing apps without affecting your real data | Fully isolated sandbox with virtual filesystem |
| Running multiple accounts of the same app | Up to 10 independent instances, each with unique identity |
| Privacy concerns with untrusted apps | Apps see only what you allow — fake contacts, fake location, fake device identity |
| Security research & app analysis | Built-in runtime analysis tools, no root required |
| App compatibility testing across device profiles | Spoof any device model, Android version, carrier, screen config |

---

## Architecture

NEXTVM is built on a **multi-layer interception architecture** that intercepts Android's IPC mechanism (Binder) at the application level, without requiring any OS modifications or root access.

### Core Mechanism

1. **Binder Proxy Interception** — `IActivityManager`, `IPackageManager`, and system service proxies intercept all app-to-system IPC calls
2. **ActivityThread.mH Hook** — Intercepts `EXECUTE_TRANSACTION` (code 159) to swap ClassLoaders and redirect Activity launches through stub components
3. **Virtual Context** — Custom `ContextWrapper` that redirects all file I/O, databases, SharedPreferences, and identity queries to the sandbox
4. **Native Hook Engine (C++)** — GOT/PLT patching for `libc` functions (`open`, `openat`, `stat`, `access`, `fopen`, `__system_property_get`) to enforce isolation at the native level
5. **200 Stub Components** — 10 process slots × 20 components each (Activities, Services, ContentProviders, BroadcastReceivers) pre-declared in the manifest

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2.1) or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35
- NDK 27.1.12297006
- CMake (for native hook module)

### Steps

```bash

## Project Status

NEXTVM is currently in **alpha stage**. The core virtualization engine, sandbox isolation, and identity spoofing systems are functional. We're actively working on expanding app compatibility and building out the advanced feature set.

### What Works

- APK installation and launch in virtual environment
- File system isolation with native-level enforcement
- Per-instance identity generation (unique device fingerprint per clone)
- Anti-detection bypasses for common root/emulator checks
- Google Play Services integration (auth, FCM, Play Store)
- Modern Compose UI with app launcher, file browser, and settings

### What's In Progress

- Expanding app compatibility (targeting 95% of Play Store apps)
- WebView process isolation
- Camera and media API proxying
- Storage Access Framework (SAF) support
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimization and memory management

## Contributing

NEXTVM is a complex systems-level project and contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

### Good First Issues

- Writing unit tests for core modules (currently at 0% coverage)
- Improving error handling and logging
- UI polish and animations
- Documentation for individual modules

### Advanced Contributions

- Android system service proxy implementations
- Native hook improvements (migrating to [bhook](https://github.com/nicklhw/bhook) for broader compatibility)
- App compatibility fixes for specific apps/frameworks
- Multi-process ClassLoader isolation improvements
- Performance profiling and optimization

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Read through the module structure — start with `core/model` to understand data types, then `core/virtualization/engine/VirtualEngine.kt` for the main orchestrator
4. Make your changes with clear commit messages
5. Submit a pull request with description of what changed and why

### Architecture Deep-Dive for Contributors

The critical code path for understanding how app virtualization works:

1. **`VirtualEngine.kt`** → `installApp()` and `launchApp()` — entry points
2. **`StubRegistry.kt`** → How 200 stub components get mapped to real app components
3. **`ActivityThreadHook.kt`** → The `EXECUTE_TRANSACTION` interception that makes everything work
4. **`ActivityManagerProxy.kt`** → How `startActivity/startService/bindService` calls get redirected
5. **`VirtualContext.kt`** → How file I/O and identity queries get sandboxed
6. **`native-hook.cpp`** → The C++ GOT/PLT patcher that enforces isolation at the native layer
